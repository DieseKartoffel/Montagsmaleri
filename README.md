Software Project for 2nd year.

Like skribbl.io but with Java, using Server Client Architecture done with RMI, User Login, Custom Wordlists, Single Player Mode against a Neural Net, Multiplayer Mode with other players over the internet (as long as server is running somewhere, any number of games can be hosted), and more.

Files are at my home PC and will be uploaded soon.
